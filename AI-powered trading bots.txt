To create AI-powered trading bots that generate trade entry and exit signals, track live performance stats, and allow subscribers to choose stocks or instruments, here's how you can achieve that:

### Step 1: **Build or Use an Existing AI Trading Bot Platform with Signal Generation**
Instead of placing live trades, your goal is to generate signals (buy/sell recommendations) based on AI-driven analysis. You can either build your own system or use platforms that allow signal generation without executing trades.

- **3Commas** and **Shrimpy** both support signal generation without executing live trades, which could be useful for your needs. You can configure bots to provide entry and exit points based on AI algorithms or custom strategies.
- If you want to build your own system from scratch, Python libraries like **TA-Lib** (Technical Analysis Library) and **QuantConnect** offer a framework to create custom trading strategies and generate signals.

### Step 2: **Set Up Live Tracking and Performance Metrics**
   - **Backtesting and Forward Testing**: Platforms like **QuantConnect**, **TradingView**, or **MetaTrader** can help you set up backtesting environments, which allow you to simulate the strategies on historical data. From there, you can move to forward testing (live performance without actual trades).
   - **Live Statistics Dashboard**: Use tools like **Grafana** or **Power BI** to create a custom dashboard that shows live performance stats of your bots. This can display important metrics like:
     - Total number of signals generated (entries/exits)
     - Success rate of the signals
     - Average profit/loss per signal
     - Real-time performance updates
   
### Step 3: **Create a Subscription Model for Your Users**
To allow subscribers to select their preferred stock or instrument and view the performance of your bots, you can implement the following:

1. **User Portal or Platform**: 
   - Build a website or app where users can sign up, select the stocks, instruments, or markets they're interested in, and view live performance data of the bots. 
   - You can use platforms like **WordPress** or **Webflow** integrated with membership plugins like **MemberPress** to allow paid subscriptions and content restriction.

2. **API Integration**: 
   - Provide subscribers with access to real-time trade signals through APIs. Tools like **Zapier**, **Integromat**, or custom-built APIs using **Flask** or **Django** can be used to send real-time signals to your users.

3. **Customizable Bot Strategies**: Allow users to configure basic parameters such as:
   - Preferred stocks or trading pairs (e.g., TSLA, AAPL, BTC-USD)
   - Risk tolerance level (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
   - Timeframes (intraday, swing, or long-term)

4. **Live Notifications and Reports**: 
   - You can provide real-time trade alerts (entry/exit signals) via email, SMS, or in-app notifications using services like **Twilio**, **Pushbullet**, or **Pushover**.
   - Offer weekly or monthly performance reports, breaking down the success of the bot and each strategy over time.

### Step 4: **Backtesting and Performance Reporting**
   - **Backtesting Tools**: If you're building your own solution, **QuantConnect** or **Backtrader** allows you to test strategies on historical data and see how they would have performed.
   - **Track Performance**: Once your bots are generating signals, monitor key performance indicators like:
     - Sharpe ratio
     - Maximum drawdown
     - Total trades, win rate, and profit factor
   - Display this data on a public-facing dashboard for subscribers to assess.

### Step 5: **Provide Access to Signals**
   - **TradingView**: If you donâ€™t want to build your own website, you can publish scripts and signals on TradingView and monetize them by offering premium access to real-time signals.
   - **Telegram/Discord Bots**: You can set up a paid subscription to a Telegram or Discord bot that automatically sends signals to subscribers. Use a payment gateway like **Stripe** or **PayPal** to manage subscriptions.
   
### Step 6: **Monetization Models**
   - **Subscription-Based Service**: Charge a monthly or yearly subscription fee for access to live signals and bot performance stats.
   - **Freemium Model**: Offer basic signals or limited access for free, with premium options that unlock more features, such as customization or access to additional bots.
   - **Affiliate Programs**: Partner with trading platforms, tools, or educational services to earn affiliate commissions when your subscribers sign up using your referral links.

### Tools and Platforms for Your Setup:
1. **Signal Generation**:
   - **QuantConnect** (for creating strategies and signals)
   - **3Commas** (for pre-built trading bots and signal generation)
   - **TradingView** (for script-based signal generation)
   
2. **Tracking and Performance Analytics**:
   - **Grafana** or **Power BI** (for live dashboards)
   - **Google Data Studio** (for reporting and analytics)

3. **Monetization**:
   - **Stripe** or **PayPal** (for subscription management)
   - **WordPress with MemberPress** (for managing subscriptions and providing access to premium content)

### Example Workflow:
1. **Set Up Bots on QuantConnect or 3Commas** to generate entry/exit signals for selected stocks or instruments.
2. **Connect Data to a Dashboard** using Grafana or Power BI to display live performance stats.
3. **Build a Website/App** where subscribers can sign up, choose stocks or instruments, and access real-time signal alerts.
4. **Send Signals to Users** via email, SMS, or a messaging platform like Telegram.
